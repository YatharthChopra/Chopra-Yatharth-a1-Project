In this game which I built, the user starts with 2 options from which they can go forward with the game. 
Then they come across new different options with one being to be able to go back. If they decide to go forward with the adventure then can, otherwise they will need to go back to stage 1. 
Then moving forward after selecting an option they are met with the final stage where they are again provided with the choice to go back or move forward.
Choosing to move forward with the game will eventually end it all together.
